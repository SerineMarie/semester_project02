                  On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
                  exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
                  of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
                  elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
                  ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
                  wind to create power.

                As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet,
                the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a
                sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. In our
                ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
                including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we
                also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter

                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
                question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?
                Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework
                for exploring and understanding our place in this world. Discover the
                origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
                evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the
                creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos,
                and a number of dinosaurs too.
